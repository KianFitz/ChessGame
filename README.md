# ChessGame

This repository holds a personal project which I am creating as an entry for learning a bunch of different tools used in programming.

It will contain 3 major projects.

* ChessGame.Core  
    >Contains the core logic, including the SDL rendering methods, the fonts, the UI, and the core game loop
* ChessGame.Multiplayer
    >Attempts to abstract the multiplayer layer as much as possible, will include both the client and the server 
* ChessGame.Engine
    >The most important part of the chess game, the actual chess engine, including searching and evaluation of the position, understanding of the different types of game notation, and more.


This project will be created in C++ and generated via CMake. It will be iterated upon generously, as I initially create the basic chess program, and optimise it more and more.
